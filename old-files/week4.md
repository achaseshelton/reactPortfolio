# Week 4

### The Finale

Our time with onboarding has come to a close, with another week packed full of content. It was another fast paced week with plenty of reading and projects. The things we covered this week included:

- Pseudocode
- Pair Programming
- Objects
- Katas
This has been a great process over the last 4 weeks. I understand much more about coding and the development process now than I would have thought possible in 4 weeks. I am really looking forward to working with my other bootcampers and instructors to continue learning and increasing my scope of knowledge.

During the last 4 weeks I have found the most helpful thing to be our help channel in Slack. The ability to ask for help from not only my other bootcamp members but also my instructors has been a huge boon for me in completing the onboarding processs. Having a fresh set of eyes on the problem you are working on can make a big difference. It was also easy reading through some of the other posts and finding some solutions that you might need for the future. The help slack channel is a great resource.

The biggest hinderance during the last 4 weeks was being remote. The inability to ask questions and get some more prompt answers was difficult at times, but it also helped me to look for good resources that I can use in the future. I was able to overcome some of the other challenges I faced with a variety of resources. The help channel in slack was big, I was also able to find various tutorials on the web and plenty of great sites to help me better understand the content we were working on. The best resource I found was <https://www.w3schools.com/>, they have a ton of references and tutorials for a variety of coding languages.

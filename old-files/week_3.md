# Week 3
## *Javascript*

Week 2 was a good preview of things to come in week 3. Last week we really amped up our speed and this week was no exception. We started learning Javascript and how it can turn something that looks nice, to something fun and interactive. There was once again a lot of material to cover, but it was certainly a rewarding week.

The best thign about all that we have been learning so far is that they all share a symbiotic relationship. HTML, CSS, and Javascript all work in tandem and all work to enhance the others. HTML is the bones of your house, CSS the decorations, and Javascript the people and things inside that make it work. Without all of them working together the user experience just isn't the same.

This blog has become an evolving space. It started out as something simple, but with the tools that we have learned so far I can begin to make it something more. I can add HTML to add things like hyperlinks, headers, asides, divs, lists, etc. WIth CSS I can add a background image, change the style and color of font, and change the size of images to fit my needs. With Javascript I can add interactivity, like buttons that change the content, add date that updates, and even add a clock.

Prior to the bootcamp we were tasked with describing how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. At the time it seemed kind of weird, but now it makes a lot more sense. We started to work with pseudocoding this week so that we could write our code in a base form to work from. The peanute butter and jelly sandwich really helped make sense. Computers seem so complex, but in reality it only takes and does what the code tells it to do. You have to make sure that you give complete instructions. Without even the simplest detail the whole of your code won't work. Pseudocoding helps you to think through your code and make sure that when you actually type your code in your language of choice its easier to convert.

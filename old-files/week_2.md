# **Week 2**

## *Fast and Furious*

After a week of learning the basics using github, codeanywhere, CLI's, and markdown, week 2 of Awesome bootcamp really turned up the speed. This week contained a lot of content to help increase my scope of knowledge. I spent a lot of time reading, interacting with tutorials, and watching videos. Among the things I learned about this week are:
- HTML
- CSS
- MDN Web Docs
- Chrome Dev Tools

One of the great things about this week and learning all of these new skills is seeing all of the wonderful possibilities that can be accomplished with coding. I can begin to understand how to make a simple webpage to contain my blog. Adding my own personal touches and making it more presentable and appealing. One of the things I currently dont know and I am looking forward to learning about is adding JavaScript to add some interactivity. I definitely want my blog to showcase all of the abilites that I have.

This week has been filled with a lot of learning, but it has also brought some struggles as well. The biggest struggle for me has been making sure that I am getting the small things right. I have come to learn that coding is a very precise thing, one little mistake can make your whole code not work. The biggest thing is slowing down, making sure that I understand what it is that I am doing, and being able to execute and fix any problems that might arise.

With all of these problems that come up during the week, it helps to have some great resources to fix them. The first resource we have available is Slack. It is essentially a chat program that we use to communicate amongst the members and instructors in the bootcamp. The ability to communicate with other members who might have encountered the same problem along the way is a great tool in my arsenal when it comes to fixing problems in my code. I have also found that a google search can yield some good results. Another great resource is the videos provided by the instructors. Simply redoing some of the simple processes over and over are great for making sure that I have all of the important details in the right places.

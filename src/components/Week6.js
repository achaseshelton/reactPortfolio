            <p>The most important thing that I learned this week was that designing is a constant process. There are always things to improve, ways to refactor, and things
            to be done to make your code better. It all starts with pseudocode. Having a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish and how you want your
            program to work is the key to writing good code.
            </p>
            <p>Developing good code has been a tough process to learn. As a beginner I think a lot of the time I take the long approach and make things a little more difficult
            on myself. Good code is easy to maintain, easy to read, and doesn't repeat itself. Getting used to some of these is going to take some time, but hopefully as my
            scope of knowledge increases my ability to write good clean code will increase as well.
            </p>
            <p>One of the most important things about being a good developer is adaptability. Technology is constantly changing and having the ability to take those changes in
            and being able to adjust on the fly is very important. An extension of adaptability is being curious and willing to learn. As technology changes, new technology and
            languages get introduced. Being able to learn and remain on the cutting edge is key to being a good developer.

            <p>Week 5 marked the beginning of our in person journey. Finally being able to get togehter in one place with all of our class mates and instructors
            was outstanding. Having all the resources avilable just a few steps away instead of the other side of a keyboard proved to be invaluable. Which turned
            out to be great because there was a lot of content to cover including objects and state. We also started the design process and working on making our blogs
            and portfolios look great.

                One of the first things that we learned this week was Bootstrap. We had heard it mentioned before in a positive light, but after working with it for a bit I found
                it to be one of the big things holding me back. It wasnt quite as intuitive as I was hoping it would be, which proved challenging. Hopefully more work and repetition with
                it will prove beneficial. One of the other things we started to learn about was JSON, a tool which I am really looking forward to learning more about, as I think it will
                be a great tool to add to my full stack developer toolkit.

                One of the questions we were asked this week is our "Why?" Why did we chose to do the bootcamp, why do we show up everyday to work and improve, and why are we going to
                continue this journey when things start to get tough. For me its my family, my wife who supports me in everything, and my kids who look up to me and need a great example
                of what hard work and dedication can do for you. Being able to show and support them is foremost for me and their sacrifice is one of the reasons I can make this journey
                possible.
